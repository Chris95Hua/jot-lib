# jot-lib
jot-lib is a collection of C++ libraries developed at Brown University, Princeton University, and the University of Michigan from the mid-1990's to 2007, and used in support of research in 3D graphics.
As of late 2007 there are no active jot developers and the [source code](https://code.google.com/p/jot-lib/) was released to the public under terms of GPLv3+.

## Jot?
In short, Jot is a program used for non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering. It lets artists (or anyone) to draw on top of a 3D model.
Similar to what Disney used on their 2012 animated short, Paperman.

In 2013, a Jot [exporter](http://ragnarb.com/resurrecting-jot/) for Blender was published by Ragnar Brynj√∫lfsson. Since we are a big fan of stylised render, Jot caught out attention.

## So what's the plan?
Our main goal is to resurrect Jot, making it works on modern OS (Windows and Linux, possibly Mac OS too) and bring native 64-bit support to it.
Other plans include, but are not limited to:
* build a proper installer
* update UI
* fix bugs
* add more features (more brushes, settings) and improve the current features

Admittedly, this is a very ambitious project, but we plan on making it happen.
